* Add FileReader, then MetadataFileReader, then CachingMetadataFileReader
  + but only after we've made the current read work
    + unless we're refactoring in the wrong direction

* Using Project sheet in Google drive for major functional items
https://docs.google.com/a/lightenna.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuXNj3kHNsfddFhwTGZpcERMd1JweTVuMEFoS3h6YUE&usp=drive_web#gid=0

Done

* setup paths bin

* install composer

* use composer to install symfony2

# install composer into bin directory using downloaded install script
php bin\install-composer.php --install-dir bin

* create a project
php -c conf bin\composer.phar create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition ./vendor/symfony2/ 

* commit everything to an open repo

* test basic route on prod

* create directory indexer like before
  + but under symfony

* setup php-dev server for dev if caching is annoying
  = didn't have to, configured normal apache to use app-dev

* setup model for record(directoryEntry)

* setup controller and route

* setup directory, file and record->directory->zip

* never add trailing / to directories
  + and make thumbnail paths work using linkpath

* Double data/ for directories with trailing /
  + http://localhost:8080/file/data/

* Images not showing from zips

* Error image

* no route found for /file

* double // for /file/ or /file

* 404 for for / or <blank>

* write test function for jazzy new performFilenameSubstitution()
  + extend to cover zips

* clipping bug when used *with* resize
  + suspect it's to do with not resetting width and height
    + better to re-read

* Write tests for image resize/clip

* Internal server error on really big image requests
  + if requested size is greater than image, just return image
